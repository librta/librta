2014-07-16  Frederic Roussel          Version 1.1.1
    - delete obsolete doc and util directories.

2014-06-22  Frederic Roussel          Version 1.1.0
    - same functionality as 0.8.2
    - debian packaging in place. it is on a separate branch: rta-debian
    - renaming to librta

2010-10-25  Bob Smith                 Version 0.8.1
    - Fixed a bug in DELETE processing.

2008-09-10  Bob Smith / Christian Werner  Version 0.8.0
    - Added support for INSERT and DELETE.  This change affects
      the table definition making this version slightly
      incompatible with previous version.
    - Modified the API to add "RTA_" or "rta_" to the front
      of all RTA defines and API routines.  COLDEF, for example
      is now RTA_COLDEF.  This change also makes this release 
      incomatible with previous versions but simple substitutions
      are all that is required to convert from previous versions.  
    - Internal functions are now defined static
    - Increased the limits for tables and columns
    - Eliminated some warnings when compiled for x86_64

2006-04-06  Bob Smith                 Version 0.7.5
    - Removed support for FUSE
    - Makefile changes include removing efence, making librtadb
      the default target and adding an 'uninstall' target
    - SQL_string() has a new calling parameter which has the
      length of input SQL string
    - The web/PHP table editor now supports multiple RTA apps,
      and supports strings with embedded single quotes.
    - Fixed a bug in the table editor in which you could not
      edit tables with more than 20 rows.
    - Switched from byacc to Bison
    - SQL statements must now be terminated by either \0 or ';'
    - Fixed bug in which an extra "'" at end of line was not
      flagged as an error.  e.g.:
      psql -h localhost -p 8888 -c "update mytable set myint=6 '"
    - We now limit the length of a returned string to the length
      as defined in the column definition


2004-11-14  Bob Smith                 Version 0.7.4
    - Read and write callbacks now return a zero on success 
      and a non-zero on failure.  A failed write callback
      restores the table row to its initial values.  No attempt
      is made to undo other side effects of callbacks so some
      care should be taken.
    - Minor web site documentation clean up.  Got fuse to run
      on the demo web server so a link to the fuse-mapped app
      directory is back in the "livedemo" page.


2004-07-26  Bob Smith                 Version 1.0.1/0.7.3
    - Added support for the new psql client protocol in which
      the very first packet from the client is a request for an
      SSL encrypted session.  We reply with an 'N' to indicate
      that SSL sessions are not yet supported.  Modified api.c.
    - Fixed a bug in the SQL parser by running flex and yacc
      under Linux (Mdk9.2) and saving the resultant .c file.
      Modified parse.c and parse.h. (1.0.1 only.  0.7.3 still
      uses parse.y as the input file.)
    - Added 0.7.3 which is a pure Makefile based version of RTA.
      It has the same code base as 1.0.1 but does not use automake.
    - Removed empd from the distribution.


2004-04-20  Graham Phillips			  Version 1.0.0.
      Added autoconf support.  Ported rta to Windows.  User may run
      './configure' and 'make' on Linux and Windows platforms.  Added
      strndup(), dirname() and mkstemp() for platforms that don't have
      these methods.  


2004-03-07 Bob Smith                              Version 0.7.2. 
    - Added a prototype daemon based on RTA.  The daemon is
      called 'empty daemon' or empd.  This addition prompted
      the addition of rta_config_dir below.
    - Fixed a bug in the iterator for the rta_tables table.
    - Fixed various typo and spelling errors.
    - Added the 'rta_config_dir' to specify a directory to be
      prepended to table savefile names.  If the savefile uses 
      an absolute path (starting with '/') it is not prepended 
      with the configuration directory.
    - Added checks to prevent the use of our reserved SQL words
      as either a table name or as a column name.  Reserved words
      are: SELECT, UPDATE, FROM, WHERE, LIMIT, OFFSET, and SET.
      (The words are reserved in both upper and lower case.)
      Changed the column name 'offset' in rta_columns to 'noff'.


2004-02-26 Bob Smith                              Version 0.7.1.
    - Replace "epg" with "rta" in all documents.
    - Verify that the name in a column definition matches the
      name of the table it is defined with.
    - Fixed a bug in which write callbacks were always passed
      a column name of NULL.
    - Removed rta_init() from API.  It is not needed and it's
      safer to do the init on the first call to rta_add_table().
    - Added another parameter to the write callback which points
      to a copy of the unmodified row.  The malloc(), memcpy(),
      and free() slows the system slightly but the ability to do
      edge detection is worth the extra CPU time.
    - The length of a string field now includes space for a
      null at the end of the string.  This bug could be a source
      of a buffer overflow.
    - Fixed a bug in selecting which columns to save to disk
      for non-volatile tables.


2004-01-03 Bob Smith                              Version 0.7.0.
    - Added a callback function, called an 'iterator', which
      advances a row pointer from one row to the next.  This
      makes it possible to have linked-lists appear as tables
      in Run Time Access.   Previous versions required that all
      data be arranged as an array of struct.
    - Minor bug fix in the table save function.
    - Rolled shared object version to '.2'.
    - Modified the table read and write callbacks to add an
      additional parameter.  Be sure to update your callbacks.


2003-12-16 Bob Smith                              Version 0.6.2.
    - Converted from PostgreSQL 7.3 protocol to PostgreSQL 7.4
      protocol.  Version 0.6.2 is *not* compatible with the
      libraries or tools of PostgreSQL 7.3.  Changes include
      removing the BEGIN and COMMIT commands and removing the
      pg_user table since these are no longer required for
      connection set up.  The function command is also removed.
    - dbcommand() now return RTA_NOBUF if there insufficient
      room in the output buffer for even an error message.


2003-08-26  Bob Smith                             Version 0.6.1.
    - Change st_atim to st_atime in rtafs.c.


2003-08-22  Bob Smith                             Version 0.6.0.  
    - Added virtual file system interface using the fuse package
      by Miklos Szeredi.  The library librtafs.a adds two API
      routines, rtafs_init() and do_rtafs(), which mount and
      maintain the program's tables as files in a file system.
    - This version also fixes a memory leak which occurred when
      the Yacc parser detected an SQL syntax error.  The amount of
      leaked memory was about equal to the lengths of the table and
      columns names in the query.


2003-04-18  Bob Smith                             Version 0.5.1.
    - Added BEGIN and COMMIT to the SQL commands recognized in
      order to allow login from Postgres 7.3.X clients.  The 7.3
      Postgres login uses a transaction as part of the login.
      The commands, while not causing an error, DO NOTHING.  There
      is no attempt in the code to implement transactions.


2003-02-19  Bob Smith                             Version 0.5.0.
    - Initial release.
